## Q2

If the first 10 lines of a data file that you want to read into R looks like this:

```
1;0;0;0;0;0
2;0;0;0;0;0
3;0;0;0;0;0
4;0;0;0;0;0
5;0;0;0;0;0
6;0;0;0;0;0
7;0;0;0;0;0
8;0;0;0;0;0
9;0;0;0;0;0
10;0;0;0;0;0
```

Fill in the missing pieces to the code below so that you could successfully read it into R (assume the tidyverse library has already been loaded):

```
library(tidyverse)

traffic_data <- read_...("urban_traffic_SaoPaulo.csv", ...)
```

> `traffic_data <- read_delim("urban_traffic_SaoPaulo.csv", col_names = FALSE)` or `traffic_data <- read_csv2("urban_traffic_SaoPaulo.csv", col_names = FALSE)`


## Q3

In 2-3 sentences and in your own words, compare and contrast lists, data frames and vectors in R.

> Lists are like super vectors that are ordered, but can be heterogenous in type. Also their elements can be of various lengths. Vectors are also ordered, but must be homogenous in type. Data frames are special lists where elements are named vectors, and the vectors must be of the same length. The vectors can be of different types.

## Q4

Write a for loop that iterates over the list given below to calculate the largest number:

temps <- list(20.2, 22.3, 19.7, 25.0, 16.3)

Hint: You can't use the `max` function, so you might need to assign a value from `temps` to start with and compare within the loop.

> ```
max <- temps[[1]]
for(i in temps){
  if(i > max){
    max = i
  }
}
print(max)
> ```

## Q5 

In order to make an effective  data visualization using `ggplot2`, you want to change the order of the levels of a factor so that they are coloured differently and ordered correctly in the legend and/or the axes. In 2-3 sentences and in your own words, state What function you should use from those listed below, and why:

1. the `forcats`'s function `fct_reorder()`;
2. the `dplyr`'s function `arrange()`;
3. any of the two - both will work.

> You should use the forcats's function fct_reorder() because it changes the levels of the factor and factor levels are what is mapped to colours or position in a plot object.

## Q6

Given the built-in `WorldPhones` matrix in R which contains the number of telephones in the the world (in thousands). 

```
     N.Amer Europe Asia S.Amer Oceania Africa Mid.Amer
1951  45939  21574 2876   1815    1646     89      555
1956  60423  29990 4708   2568    2366   1411      733
1957  64721  32510 5230   2695    2526   1546      773
1958  68484  35218 6662   2845    2691   1663      836
1959  71799  37598 6856   3000    2868   1769      911
1960  76036  40341 8220   3145    3054   1905     1008
```

Fill in the code below to get the number of phones in Oceania and Europe when the number of phones in North America is the lowest. Your answer should be a data frame with two columns.

Note 1: the data above is in thousands, so 555 means 555,000 phones.
Note 2: we use `as_tibble` below to convert the matrix to a tibble.

```
library(tidyverse)

as_tibble(WorldPhones) |>
arrange(...) |>
...(Oceania,Europe) |>
  ...(...)
```

> ```
as_tibble(WorldPhones) |>
arrange(desc(N.Amer)) |>
select(Oceania,Europe) |>
  slice(1)
> ```

## Q7

```
library(tidyverse)

section_mins <- tibble(course = c("Biology 102", "Psychology 301", "Chemistry 101", "Geology 202"),
                      UBC = c(89, 80, 81, 75),
                      SFU = c(81, 89, 79, 78),
                      UVIC = c(88, 85, 83, 98),
                      term = c(1, 2, 2, 1))
```
                      
```                      
# A tibble: 4 x 5
  course           UBC   SFU  UVIC  term
  <chr>          <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
1 Biology 102       89    81    88     1
2 Psychology 301    80    89    85     2
3 Chemistry 101     81    79    83     2
4 Geology 202       75    78    98     1
```

We are interested in answering the question what influences minimum grade in a course with the data shown above (For eg: 75 is the minimum grade for course Geology 202 at UBC).  Fill in the code below needed to make the above data frame (named `section_mins`) tidy.

```
section_mins_tidy <- ...(section_mins, ..., ..., ...)
```

> `section_mins_tidy <- pivot_longer(section_mins, UBC:UCIV, names_to = "universities", values_to = "minimum_grade")`

## Q8

```
  name   place       age
  <chr>  <chr>     <dbl>
1 James  Vancouver    43
2 George Richmond     23
3 Cathy  Surrey       67
4 Mike   Vancouver    34
5 Matt   Richmond     89
6 Gerald Surrey       21
```

Fill in the missing pieces to the code below so that the output of the above dataframe (people) is the following;

```
"Cathy"
```

```
library(tidyverse)
val |> ...(...) |> ...(name)
```

>`library(tidyverse)
val |> filter(age == 67) |> pull(name) OR val |> slice(3) |> pull(name)
